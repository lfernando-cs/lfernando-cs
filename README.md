## 🤖 About Me  

I'm a **Full Stack Software Engineer and Tech Lead** passionate about building scalable, high-performance web applications and leading teams to deliver real-world impact.  
I enjoy transforming complex problems into clean, efficient, and user-centric digital solutions.

Beyond coding, I'm highly involved in the **tech community as a Community Lead**, actively participating and speaking at events such as **Google Developer Groups (GDG)**, where I contribute to knowledge sharing, mentorship, and developer growth.

I thrive at the intersection of:
